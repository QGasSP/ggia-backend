########### Explanation #######################
# The calculations work by describing the economy as being
# composed of 200 products, given by 'products'.
# For each product there is an emission intensity and they are collected
# together in emission_intensities.
# There are separate emission intensities for the 'direct production'
# and the 'indirect production' (rest of the supply chain).
# So emission_intensities is a 200 x 2 table.
# Some products that describe household fuel use for heat and
# also transport fuel use for cars have another emission
# intensity as well. These are held in separate tables
# 'use_phase' and 'tail_pipe' (all other products have 0 here)

# To calculate the emissions, each value in emission_intensities + the values in use_phase
# and tail_pipe are multiplied by the amount the household spends
# on each of the 200 products. These are stored in another table
# called demand_kv (demand vector).
# The emissions for each product from the direct production,
# indirect production, and use_phase/tail_pipe are summed
# to get the total emissions for that product.

# Once we have the total emissions for each product for that year,
# they are grouped together into 'sectors' that describe different things.
# There are 7 in total:
# Household Energy, Household Other, transport fuels, transport other, air transport, food,
# tangible goods, and services

# The calculations are performed every year until 2050,
# with the values of demand_kv and emission_intensities changing slighting each year.
# This is based on 3 factors, efficiency improvements,
# changes in income and changes in household size. There is also a
# section where these projections can change as a result
# of different policies (for the baseline no policies are introduced)
